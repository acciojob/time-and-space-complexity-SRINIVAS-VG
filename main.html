<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>

<p>The algorithm that performs the task in the smallest number of operations is considered the most efficient one in terms of the time complexity. However, the space and time complexity are also affected by  factors such as your operating system and hardware, but we are not including them in this discussion.</p>
<p>Space Complexity O(n) – linear complexity – takes space directly proportional to the input size</p>
<b>Space complexity refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution</b>
